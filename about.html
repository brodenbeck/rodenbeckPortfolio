					<p>I spent my undergraduate days studying the psychological sciences before making this shift to web development. My days were filled with learning about the brain, and my nights were filled with research. I worked with several professors and other students in the hope of decipehering the large gender gap in STEM fields, looking first at middle and high school students. We studied perceived utility, or usefulness, of the material, and mindset.</p>
					<blockquote cite="http://www.niu.edu/imuscle/pdfs/DurikSchmidtShumowRodenbeckAERAFINAL1.pdf">Ironically, girls with high expectancies for success in science may have talked themselves out of their interest in science by ... reified gender stereotypes (Durik, Shumow, Schmidt, &amp; Rodenbeck, 2014).</blockquote>
					<p> The gender gap is something that has stuck with me a long time, since the beginning of the study. I believe that's what sparked me to enter into the field: to be able to succeed and show other females that they can as well. I have a passion for problem-solving and learning, and I want to share my experience with others along the way.</p>
					<p>Here are some things you should know about me:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>I live in Detroit, Michigan, but I grew up in Rockford, Illinois.</li>
						<li>I am <strong>obsessed</strong> with tacos. I could eat tacos for every meal forever, and I would very much like to open a taco food truck called britTACOS.</li>
						<li>I wear a size 6 1/2 shoe.</li>
						<li>I have a pet cat, but what I really want is a nice, potbellied pig.</li>
					</ol>
