					<p class="port-para">The purpose of this website is to give as much information as possible about the event to the guests of the wedding. Using HTML, CSS, and Twitter Bootstrap, the website is coded so that attendees can easily find information on the location, attire, and other aspects of the weekend. Eventually, RSVPs will be accepted here, as well.</p>

					<p class="port-para">Although I did not code this website, I helped to design it by contributing photographs and content. I worked closely with the staff member in charge of the development to ensure that the design followed both university standards and our own as a research group.</p>

					<p class="port-para">This paper sparked my interest in STEM fields. The study looked into middle and high school students in science courses and measured their perceived utility of the course materials and their mindset while engaging with those materials. Outcomes such as projected future involvement in sciences were measured and showed a disparity between genders.</p>
